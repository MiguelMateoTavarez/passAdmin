<h1>Pass admin</h1>

<p>This small program is characterized by allowing you to manage your passwords, thus being a password manager.</p>

<p>
  Being able to test the program is really simple, but first of all the tabulate module must be installed to be able to see the tables correctly formed in the console,     for this we execute the following command.
</p>

<strong>pip install tabulate</strong>
